The sample shows how to build a pipeline processing textual files.
The files should be imported and then some statistics are computed, like the number of words that part of the text and others.
Statistics are then persisted into log file, that you can inspect after running the sample application.

The network is rendered with a python script using graphviz (which is expected to have already been installed with **pip**). Notice that the network rendering is blocking and you should close the generated window and press enter to progress and get to the end.
